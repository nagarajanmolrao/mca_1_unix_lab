#Unix Lab Programs

**1a. Write a shell script that takes a valid directory name as a argument recursively descend all the sub-directories, find the maximum length of any file in that hierarchy and write the maximum value to the standard output.**

```
if [ $# -eq 1 ]
then
	if [ -e $1 ]
	then
		largeFile=$(find $1 -printf '%k %p\n' | sort -nr | head -n 1 | 
			cut -d " " -f 2)
		echo "Larget File in the directory: $largeFile"

	else
		echo "Path does not exist! Please check the path."
		exit 0
	fi
else
	echo "This script takes only one valid directory name as an arguement!"
fi
```

######COMMAND DETAILS:
> *find* : find command searches for a file in directory hierarchy
			 >> %k: amount of disk space used by the file in 1KB Blocks  
			 >> %p: file's name

> *sort* : sorts the lines of text files
			>> -n : numeric sort   
			>> -r : reverse sort

> *head* : output from part of the file
			>> -n : number of lines to be printed starting from 1

> *cut* : removes sections from each line of the file
			>> -d : delimiting character at which the line has to be split   
			>> -f : print n or nth field(s) in the result after cut   

######OUTPUT:
```
nanmolrao@aloo:~/mca_1_unix_lab$ sh script_1a.sh ~/mca_1_unix_lab/
Larget File in the directory: /home/nanmolrao/mca_1_unix_lab/
		unix_lab_study_material.md
nanmolrao@aloo:~/mca_1_unix_lab$
```


**1b. Write a shell script that accepts a path name and creates all the components in that path name as directories. For example, if the script is named as mpc, then the command mpc a/b/c/d should create sub-directories a, a/b, a/b/c, a/b/c/d**

```
if [ $# -eq 1 ]
then
	mkdir -pv $1
else
	echo "This Script is only programmed to take one arguement as an input!"
fi
```

######COMMAND DETAILS:
> *mkdir* : make directories
			>> -p : make parent directories in the given path, if not existing  
			>> -v : print a message for each directory created (verbose output)   

######OUTPUT:
```
nanmolrao@aloo:~/mca_1_unix_lab$ sh script_1b.sh 
	oxford/engineering/mca/2020/Sem1
mkdir: created directory 'oxford'
mkdir: created directory 'oxford/engineering'
mkdir: created directory 'oxford/engineering/mca'
mkdir: created directory 'oxford/engineering/mca/2020'
mkdir: created directory 'oxford/engineering/mca/2020/Sem1'
nanmolrao@aloo:~/mca_1_unix_lab$ 
```

			
**2a. Write a shell script that accepts two filenames as arguments, checks if the permissions for these files are identical and if the permissions are identical, output common permissions otherwise output each filename followed by its permissions.**

```
if [ $# -eq 2 ]
then
	
	PERM1=$(stat --printf=”%a”  $1)
	PERM2=$(stat --printf=”%a”  $2)

	if [ "$PERM1" = "$PERM2" ]
	then
		echo Both the files have same permissions: $(stat --printf="%A" $1)
	else
		echo The given files have different permissions
		echo "$1 : $(stat --printf="%A" $1)"
		echo "$2 : $(stat --printf="%A" $2)"
	fi
else
	echo "This script is programmed to use two files in order 
		to compare their permissions"

fi
```

######COMMAND DETAILS:
> *stat* : display file or filesystem status
			>> %a : access rights in octal  
			>> %A : access rights in Human Readable Format   

######OUTPUT:
```
nanmolrao@aloo:~/mca_1_unix_lab$ sh script_2a.sh script_1a.sh

Both the files have same permissions: -rwxrwxr-x
nanmolrao@aloo:~/mca_1_unix_lab$ 
```

			
**2b. Write a shell script which accepts valid log-in names as arguments and prints their corresponding home directories, if no arguments are specified, print a suitable error message.**

```
if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then
	echo "Run this script with one or more  username(s) as arguement!"
else
	for i in $*
	do
		if [ $(grep $i /etc/passwd) ]
		then
			echo "Home directory for $i: "
			eval "echo ~$i"
		else
			echo "user does not exsist"
		fi
	done
fi
```
######COMMAND DETAILS:
> *grep* : print lines that match a given pattern

**3a. Create a script file called file properties that reads a filename entered and outputs it properties.**

```
if [ $# -ne 1 ]
then
	echo "Run this cript with only one filename as arguement!"
else
	if [ -f "$1" ]
	then
		echo "Name : $1"
		echo "Permissions : $(stat --printf="%A" $1)"
		echo "Type: $(stat --printf="%F" $1)"
		echo "Owner: $(stat --printf="%U" $1)"

**3b. Write a shell script to implement terminal locking (Similar to the lock command). It should prompt for the user for a password. After accepting the password entered by the user, it must prompt again for the matching password as confirmation and if match occurs, it must lock the keyword until a matching password is entered again by the user. Note the Script must be written to disregard BREAK, control-D. No time limit need be implemented for the lock duration.**

```
while true
do
	clear
	echo "**Password entered will not visible for security reasons**"
	echo "Enter Password: "
	read -s passFirst
	echo "Re-enter Password: "

In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea.
Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. 
Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.
In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.

**9b. Write a shell script that folds long lines into 40 columns. Thus any line that
exceeds 40 characters must be broken after 40th, a “/” is to be appended as the indication of folding and processing is to be continued with the residue. The input is to be supplied through a text file created by the user.**

```
if [ $# -ne 1 ]
then
	echo "This script takes in only one filename as arguement!"
	exit 1
else
	if [ -f $1 ]
	then
		echo  "**ORIGINAL FILE**"
		cat $1
		printf "\n"
		echo "**FOLDED FILE**"
		fold -s -w 40 $1 | sed 's/$/\//'
	else
		echo "file doesn't exist"
	fi
fi
```

######COMMAND DETAILS:
> *fold* :  wrap each input line to fit in specified width
			>> -s : break at spaces   
			>> -w : width of columns

> *sed* : stream editor for filtering and transforming text   
			>> s/regexp/replacement/ : search and attempt to match the given regular expression against the pattern space and If search is successful, replace the portion matched with the replacement.  
			>> '$' : Regex pattern representing End of Line  
			>> '/\' : Escape Character for BackwardSlash (\)
